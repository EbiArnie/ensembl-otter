Roadmap for storing evidence alignments
=======================================


Pre-requisite steps
-------------------

* Re-visit OTF of evidence against spliced transcript, and invoke the
  splitting of alignment into exons according to transcript structure.

  The split alignments to be stored in SQLite (as for the revised
  OTF-vs-genome system) and passed to ZMap (or straight to blixem)
  for display.

* A link will need to be made from the AceDB transcripts to the SQLite
  spliced alignment tables. This may imply a dependency on moving out
  of AceDB. (See also next point.)

* Design extension to loutre schema for linking transcripts to
  evidence alignments. This will need to take account of the existing
  evidence table.

* Ensure that the necessary tables are in place in our loutre
  databases.

* Design an extension to our XML schema for get_/write_region to
  accommodate evidence alignments.


Issues
------

* What happens when transcripts are mapped onto a new assembly? The
  evidence alignments will need to re-generated or mapped.

* Will the OTF of new evidence against the spliced transcript be a
  required part of the annotator's workflow, or will there be some
  automation?

* Evidence alignments will need to be invalidated (and recreated) if
  the annotator edits the transcript structure.
