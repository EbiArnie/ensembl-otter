#  This perlcriticrc file checks for things that will make webpublish
#  reject files.  Do not treat it as a style checker.  To satisfy
#  webpublish the following command should produce no output when run
#  from the top of the ensembl-otter repository:
#
#      perlcritic --quiet --profile xt/webpublish.perlcriticrc modules/Bio scripts/apache
